# Brave-appimage
Unofficial AppImages for Brave Web Browser x86_64/AMD64 and aarch64/ARM64

## Reason
It was missing from my collection of Chromium-based browsers... so I created this repository for consistency.

This repository provides continuous builds.

If you are looking for more releases (for x86_64), visit https://github.com/srevinsaju/Brave-AppImage

Personally I'm not interested in taking away work from colleagues... I had my own method for building the AppImage and wanted to publish it.

I hope you find it useful.

## How to install using "AM"
Since my colleagues have done a great job, as long as they maintain their build, it will remain in the "AM" database, you can install my build using the option `-e` or `extra`
```
am -e https://github.com/ivan-hc/Brave-appimage name channel
```
For example, to install the stable version with the name "brave", use
```
am -e https://github.com/ivan-hc/Brave-appimage brave stable
```
or add the `--user` flag before the url to install it locally
```
am -e --user https://github.com/ivan-hc/Brave-appimage brave stable
```

Replace "`stable`" with "`beta`" or "`nightly`" depending on the build you want.

Replace "`brave`" if you want to give the installed app an alternative name, for example "`brave-beta`", "`brave-nightly`", "`the-chromium-orange`" and so on.

Learn more about the `-e` or `extra` usage at **https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM/blob/main/docs/guides-and-tutorials/extra.md**

*"AM"/"AppMan" is a set of scripts and modules for installing, updating, and managing AppImage packages and other portable formats, in the same way that APT manages DEBs packages, DNF the RPMs, and so on... using a large database of Shell scripts inspired by the Arch User Repository, each dedicated to an app or set of applications.*

*The engine of "AM"/"AppMan" is the "APP-MANAGER" script which, depending on how you install or rename it, allows you to install apps system-wide (for a single system administrator) or locally (for each user).*

*"AM"/"AppMan" aims to be the default package manager for all AppImage packages, giving them a home to stay.*

*You can consult the entire **list of managed apps** at [**portable-linux-apps.github.io/apps**](https://portable-linux-apps.github.io/apps).*
